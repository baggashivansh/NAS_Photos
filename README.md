# Photos_House_NAS

A Flutter project to solve the problem of Google photos now being discontinued for free storage of photos.
This Application uses Wifi router's ftp server function to create a home wireless NAS system to automatically upload and download photos from the camera folder of the phone.

## ISSUES
Unable to preview ftp images using flutter's network image plugin inside the app.
